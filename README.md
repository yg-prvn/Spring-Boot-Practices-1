Project Description: Greeting Application with Spring Boot
The "Greeting Application" is a beginner-level project developed using the Spring Boot framework. This application demonstrates the creation of a simple RESTful web service that generates personalized greetings. It showcases the key concepts of Spring Boot, including dependency injection, RESTful APIs, and the use of record types in Java.

Features
RESTful Endpoint:
The application exposes an endpoint /greetings for generating a greeting message.
Users can provide their name as a query parameter to receive a personalized greeting.

Dynamic Greeting Generation:
When a user sends a request with a name parameter, the application returns a greeting message in the format "Hello, [name]!".
If no name is provided, it defaults to "World."

Unique Identifier:
Each greeting response includes a unique ID that increments with every request, ensuring a distinct identification for each greeting.

Atomic Counter:
The project leverages AtomicLong to maintain a thread-safe counter for generating unique IDs.

Technical Details
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot (for building the RESTful service)
Java 17+ (includes use of modern features like record)

Architecture:
The project follows a clean and modular architecture with separate classes for the main application, controller, and data model.
REST API Endpoint:
URL: /greetings
Method: GET
Parameters:
name (optional): The name of the person to greet.

Classes
SpringBootPractices1Application:
The main entry point for the Spring Boot application.
Bootstraps the application using the SpringApplication.run() method.

Greeting:
A lightweight data record that encapsulates the greeting message and its unique ID.
Fields: id (long), content (String).

GreetingsController:
A REST controller that handles HTTP GET requests to the /greetings endpoint.
Contains the logic to format and return the greeting response.

How It Works
The application starts using Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities.
When a client sends a GET request to /greetings, the greeting method in GreetingsController is invoked.
The method formats a greeting message using the provided name or defaults to "World."
A Greeting object is returned as the response, containing the unique ID and the greeting message.

Potential Use Cases
Learning Project: Ideal for individuals new to Spring Boot to understand the basics of RESTful API development.
Template for APIs: Can be extended to create more complex APIs by adding features like database integration or authentication.
